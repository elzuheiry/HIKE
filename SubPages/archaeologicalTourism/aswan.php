                    Historians believe that the temple was built in the era of King
                    Thutmose III. However, this is difficult to prove, because it is the
                    temple that remains to this day that depicts many of the Ptolemaic
                    rulers, the last rulers of the Pharaonic era, and what scholars know
                    is that the physical structure of the Khnum temple dates back to the
                    Greco-Roman period in Egypt.
